KDNuggets-Data-Mining-Course
============================

A new accademic year starts and I always want to learn from the most famous authors or books.
In the data mining field the KDNuggets website (http://www.kdnuggets.com/) is an authority. It has a specific
section (data_mining_course) which let you to access to some useful slides about data mining.

Unfortunately the author has inserted the link separating the *url* from the *url path* of each single file.

I don't want to copy-paste things, so I've created this simple and useful Golang program that automatically 
generates in your current directory all the *ppt* files.
